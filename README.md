# Heart Disease Prediction ❤️

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on a tutorial from GeeksforGeeks ([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression/)). The original work provided a comprehensive guide, which I followed to develop this project.\
While the structure and concept are inspired by the tutorial, I have made modifications and additions to fit my understanding and requirements.


# 📝 Overview
  This project focuses on using Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. 
  By analyzing health metrics and lifestyle factors, the model aims to assist in early detection and promote timely medical intervention.

# 🚀 Features
Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.\
Machine Learning: Use of classification models for accurate predictions.\
Visualization: Graphical representation of correlations and trends in health metrics.\
User-friendly: Clean and modular code for easy understanding and future updates.

# Goal

The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).\
The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
